Provides classes for parsing and interpreting cube scripts.


<h2>Package Specification</h2>

The Parser is very flexible. A Notation object describes the tokens and syntax
used by the Parser. The result of the parsing process is the parse tree. The
parse tree consists of Node objects. A Node in a parse tree can be applied to
a Cube object in order to alter the state of the Cube object.
A ScriptPlayer can be used to play a script represented as a parse tree.
