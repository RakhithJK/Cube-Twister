<H1>Order of Permutation</H1>
<p>The order of a permutation tells us, how many distinct states of the cube can be achieved by performing the permutation.</p>
<P>For example, if the order of a permutation is 3, we can achieve 3 distinct states of the cube using this permutation. Applying the permutation a first time to the cube, results in a new distinct state of the cube. Applying it a second time also yields a new distinct state. Applying it a third time brings us back to the  state we started with.</P>
