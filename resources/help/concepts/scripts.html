A solver describes a transition from an unsolved state of the    cube towards the solved state. A generator describes a transition from a solved    state of the cube to an unsolved state of the cube.</P><P>CubeTwister features    a powerful <A HREF="../reference/script_editor/script_editor.html">script editor</A>. You can    enter a script by keying it in, you can record a script, and you can generate    a script using the solver. CubeTwister's script editor also supports translation    of scripts from one <A HREF="notations.html">notation</A> to another.</P><P>Scripts    are managed per document. To see the scripts in the current document open the    folder named <I>&laquo;Scripts&raquo;</I> in the tree.</P><H2>See also:</H2><UL>    <LI>        <A HREF="../tasks/scripts.html">Working with scripts</A></LI>    <LI><A HREF="../reference/script_editor/script_editor.html">The        script editor</A></LI>    <LI><A HREF="../tasks/tree.html">Working with the tree</A>        <P></P></UL></BODY></HTML>
