<H1>Permutation Notation</H1>
<P>The permutation notation is used to
    describe location and orientation changes of cube parts.</P>
<H2>Components of
    a Rubik's Cube:</H2>
<P>A Rubik's Cube has 6 faces.</P>
<P>It has 6 side parts,
    8 corner parts and 12 edge parts.</P>
<P>Side parts have 1 sticker, edge parts
    have 2 stickers, corner parts have 3 stickers.</P>
<H2>Describing the location
    of a part:</H2>
<P>The location of a part can be described by listing the faces
    on which the stickers of the part can be seen.</P>
<P> e.g. The faces can be denoted by
    the letters: &laquo;r&raquo;, &laquo;u&raquo;, &laquo;f&raquo;, &laquo;l&raquo;,
    &laquo;d&raquo;, &laquo;b&raquo; (right, up, front, left, down, back).</P>
<P>
    e.g. &laquo;r&raquo; describes that the sticker
    of
    a
    side
    part
    can
    be
    seen
    from
    the right of the cube.</P>
<P>e.g. &laquo;fu&raquo; describes that the stickers
    of an edge part can be seen at the front and upper faces of the cube.</P>
<P>e.g.
    &laquo;frd&raquo; describes that the stickers of a corner part can be seen at

    the front, right, and down faces of the cube.</P>
<H2>Describing location changes
    of parts:</H2>
<P>Location changes always happen in cycles. If a part moves into
    the location of another part, then that part must move as well. This may trigger
    more location changes until one part closes the cycle by moving into the start
    location of the cycle.</P>
<P>To describe a cycle, we list the location of the
    parts in the sequence of the change. Each cycle is enclosed in brackets. Each
    location description is separated by a comma.</P>
<P>e.g. &laquo;(fu,fr,fd,fl)&raquo;
    describes, that the edge part at &laquo;fu&raquo; moves to &laquo;fr&raquo;,
    &laquo;fr&raquo; moves to &laquo;fd&raquo;, &laquo;fd&raquo; moves to &laquo;fl&raquo;,

    and &laquo;fl&raquo; moves to &laquo;(fu)&raquo;.</P>
<P>e.g. &laquo;(fu,fd)
    (lf,rf)&raquo; denotes two disjoint cycles. &laquo;fu&raquo; and &laquo;fd&raquo;
    are swapping their locations, and &laquo;lf&raquo; and &laquo;rf&raquo; are

    swapping their locations as well.</P>
<H2>Describing orientation changes of parts:</H2>
<P>When
    the orientation of a part changes, then it stickers can be seen in a different
    sequence on the faces of the cube.</P>
<P>The face names in a cycle can be used
    to describe orientation changes as well. The first face name in a location description
    denotes where the first sticker goes. The second face name in a location description
    denotes where the second sticker goes, and so on.</P>
<P>e.g. &laquo;(fu,fr,...)&raquo;
    describes, that the first sticker on face &laquo;f&raquo; at edge location &laquo;<U>f</U>u&raquo;
    goes to face &laquo;f&raquo; at edge location &laquo;<U>f</U>r&raquo;, and the
    second sticker on face &laquo;u&raquo; at location &laquo;f<U>u</U>&raquo; goes
    to face &laquo;r&raquo; at location &laquo;f<U>r</U>&raquo;.</P>
<P>e.g. &laquo;(ufl,rfu,...)&raquo;
    describes, that the first sticker on face &laquo;u&raquo; at corner location &laquo;<U>u</U>fl&raquo;
    goes to face &laquo;r&raquo; at corner location &laquo;<U>r</U>fu&raquo;, the
    second sticker on face &laquo;f&raquo; at corner location &laquo;u<U>f</U>l&raquo;
    goes to face &laquo;f&raquo; at &laquo;r<U>f</U>u&raquo;, and the third sticker
    on &laquo;l&raquo; at &laquo;uf<U>l</U>&raquo; goes to &laquo;u&raquo; at &laquo;rf<U>u</U>&raquo;.</P>
<H2>Describing
    the orientation change of the last part in a cycle</H2>
<P>To denote an orientation
    change of the last edge part in a cycle, we prepend a &laquo;+&raquo; to the location
    description of the first part of the cycle.</P>
<P>To denote an orientation change
    in clockwise direction of the last corner part in a cycle, we prepend a &laquo;+&raquo;
    to the location description of the first part in the cycle. To denote an orientation
    change in anticlockwise direction, we prepend a &laquo;-&raquo;.</P>
<P>e.g. &laquo;(+fu,fr)&raquo;
    describes that the sticker on face &laquo;f&raquo; of the last part &laquo;<U>f</U>r&raquo;
    goes to face &laquo;u&raquo; of the first part &laquo;f<U>u</U>&raquo;, and the
    sticker &laquo;r&raquo; of &laquo;f<U>r</U>&raquo; goes to &laquo;f&raquo; at
    &laquo;<u>f</u>u&raquo;.</P>
<H2>Describing orientation changes of side parts:</H2>
<P>A
    side part can have four different orientations. Since we can not tell the orientation
    of a side part from its location name, we have to use a prefix. No prefix denotes
    that the side part is in its default orientation. &laquo;+&raquo; denotes that
    the side part is oriented at 90&deg; in clockwise direction. &laquo;++&raquo;
    denotes that the side part is oriented at 180&deg;. &laquo;-&raquo; denotes that
    the side part is oriented at 90&deg; in anticlockwise direction.</P>
<P>An orientation
    change is denoted by the difference between the orientation of the part at the
    current location and the orientation of the part at the next location.</P>
<P>To
    describe the orientation change of the last part in a cycle, we prepend an orientation
    token to the first part in the cycle.</P>
<P>e.g. &laquo;(f,+r)&raquo; describes
    that the side part at location &laquo;f&raquo; moves to &laquo;r&raquo; and changes
    its orientation by 90&deg; in clockwise direction. The side part at &laquo;r&raquo;
    moves to &laquo;f&raquo; and changes its orientation by 90&deg; in anticlockwise
    direction.</P>
<P>e.g. &laquo;(+f,+r)&raquo; describes that the side part at location
    &laquo;f&raquo; moves to &laquo;r&raquo; and changes its orientation by 90&deg;
    in clockwise direction. The side part at &laquo;r&raquo; moves to &laquo;f&raquo;
    without changing its orientation.</P>
